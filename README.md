## Purpose
#### The goal of Deployment 6 was to enhance the reliability of our banking application infrastructure. By doing this, we increase the confidence of our users, ensuring they have consistent and uninterrupted access to our services. This growth in user confidence will cause an increase in user loyalty which directly translates into more transactions & revenue.

#### Our last deployment, 5.1, decoupled our application from our Jenkins server. This partially addressed the single point of failure issue and using Jenkins agents made our system architecture more distributed. However, our infrastructure was still allocated in a single region, leaving our system vulnerabe to a disaster and possible latency issues. We were also using SQLite, leaving our customers data exposed to anything that has access to our server. Our 2nd application server was also just used as a standby instance incase an availability zone went down.

#### In Deployment 6, we solved several issues that our last deployment left us with.
* #### We added an additional 2 application servers in US-West-2 for a multi-region infrastructure that'll fully address the single point of failure issue, ensuring that our application is prepared to still service customers in the event of a disaster
* #### We added a single load balancer in each region to equally distribute ingreess traffic amongst our 2 instances that are in seperate AZs, increasing our banking applications availability to facilitate users transactions.
* #### We decoupled our database from our application by moving away from SQLite and using AWS RDS and this came at a cost of an increase in latency sinces we're no longer reading and writing data locally. However, we increased the scalability and flexibility of our database conponent. We also took a step ij the direction of making our users data more secure.
* #### We intergrated Terraform into our Jenkins pipeline, deploying our infrastructure via a Jenkins agent, which optimized our applications infrastructure depoyment proceess.

## Steps
#### 1. Download banking application source code from GitHub to local machine
* ##### _Create a GitHub token_
* ##### _Run this script to create a remote GitHub repository using your token (GitHub Repo Creation Script)_
* ##### _Set the remote GitHub repository in your local repository_
* ##### _Clone the source code from GitHub into our local repo and push into the remote repo_
* ##### _Create our second branch calld "dev1" to build our infrastructure_
_
#### 2. Use Terraform to deploy our CICD infrastructure using Jenkins controller/agent architecture
* ##### _Switch to our "dev1" branch_
* ##### _Create 3 Terraform files called "main.tf", "variables.tf" & "terraform.tfvars"_
* ##### _Usimg Terraform, configure 2 EC2 instances, 1 for our Jenkins controller server and 1 for our Jenkins agent server_
* ##### _Create a userdata script to install the dependencides for each instance_
* ##### _Deploy the 2 Jenkins instances_

3. #### Store AWS credentials as enviornment variables in Jenkins
* #### _Follow the steps outlined here to store credintals in GitHub_

4. #### _Set up AWS RDS database_
* ##### _Follow the steps outlined here to store credintals in GitHub_

5. #### Deploy our multi-region banking application infrastructure from our Jenkins agent using Terraform
* ##### _Configure Terraform files to deploy:_
    * ##### _2 VPC's (US-East-1, US-West-2)_
    * ##### _2 Route Tables_
    * ##### _2 Subnets in each region (US-East-1, US-West-2)_
    * ##### _2 Availability Zones in each region (US-East-1, US-West-2)_
    * ##### _1 Internet Gateway in each region (US-East-1, US-West-2)_
    * ##### _2 EC2 instances in each region (US-East-1, US-West-2)_
    * ##### _2 Route Tables_
* ##### _Use the following setup script to download and launch our application on each instance_

6. #### Configure a load balancer for each region our banking application is deployed in
* ##### _Create a task for each application instance_
* ##### _Create a load balancer_
* ##### _Attach each task to the load balancer_
* ##### _Check our application at the load balancers URL_
